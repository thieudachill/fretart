# FretArt

Real-time web app that tracks a guitarist's hands via webcam and renders layered
generative visuals driven by finger motion. Inspired by the TouchDesigner clip in
`reference/` (fingertip-anchored polygon filled with riso/halftone screen-print
rendering of the live feed).

## Run

```
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173 — grant webcam access
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Hotkeys: `H` hide UI (filming mode) · `F` fullscreen · `D` tracking debug overlay.

## Architecture (data flows one way)

```
camera.ts → handTracker.ts → features.ts → modMatrix.ts → engine.ts (effect chain) → screen
                                (FrameFeatures)                 ↑ panel.ts (Tweakpane UI)
```

- `src/tracking/features.ts` — **the reusable foundation.** Converts MediaPipe
  landmarks into smoothed screen-space features (fingertip positions/velocities,
  pinch distances, spread, presence envelope). Renderer-agnostic; future
  chord/note detection, MIDI/OSC, or audio-reactive modules consume this too.
  `FEATURE_SOURCES` is the registry of named 0..1 signals the mod matrix can route.
- `src/effects/Effect.ts` — every visual is an `EffectBase` subclass with a
  `paramDefs` schema (drives Tweakpane UI + mod-matrix targets automatically).
  Effects render in chain order over ping-pong render targets; each is
  independently toggleable. **To add an effect:** new file in `src/effects/`,
  register it in `main.ts`. Nothing else changes.
- Chain order (set in `main.ts`): video base → riso → particles → strings →
  echo last, so feedback smears the whole composite.
- `src/mapping/modMatrix.ts` — routes features to params as *additive offsets*
  on top of slider base values (sliders are never overwritten).
- `src/ui/presets.ts` — built-ins ('Print Shop', 'Neon Strings', 'Full Collage')
  + localStorage saves + JSON export/import. Presets capture global state,
  per-effect enabled/values, and routings.
- Palettes live in `src/core/types.ts` (`PALETTES`) — shared ink/paper colors so
  all layers cohere. Presets reference palettes by index, so only append, never
  reorder.

## Palette notes (art references)

User feedback (2026-07): the strings/shapes genre works best; high-saturation
additive RGB reads as un-aesthetic. Muted palettes + normal "ink" blending are
the preferred direction.

- **Studio Ink** — one-line contour drawing tradition (Picasso/Cocteau) and
  pen-plotter generative art: warm paper, graphite, one vermilion accent.
- **Pastel Play** — Zach Lieberman's gesture sketches / Matisse cut-outs:
  paper tone with soft pink/blue/periwinkle.
- **Morandi** — Giorgio Morandi still-life tones; dusty low-chroma neutrals.
- **Cyanotype** — Anna Atkins blueprint prints: Prussian-blue paper, pale lines
  (inks ordered dark→light so `inks[2]`, the "drawing ink", is the palest).
- Ink ordering convention: `inks[2]` is the strongest drawing/contour ink;
  `inks[0]` the lightest wash/fill.

## Effects

- `fingerShapes.ts` ('shapes') — one shape from all visible fingertips (angle-
  sorted, closed Catmull-Rom): style 0 contour line, 1 filled cut-out, 2
  constellation (all-pair hairlines + dots). In style 1, `fillStyle` picks the
  area treatment rendered inside the shape (screen-space video sampling, so
  the shape is a lens): 0 flat ink, 1 halftone duotone, 2 posterized inks,
  3 negative, 4 pixel mosaic, 5 stipple dither; `density` scales dots/cells.
- `facetFold.ts` ('facets') — the 4-fingertip quad as a folded screen-printed
  sheet: `mode` 0 = fold-2 (diagonal ridge peel), 1 = pyramid-4 (centroid
  apex). Each facet gets its own "printing plate" (`pattern` recipes: 0
  reference dither/sparse/poster/halftone, 1 duotone, 2 window, 3 minimal) at
  its own halftone screen angle (`angle` step, print-shop style), Lambert-
  shaded by one virtual key light (`shade`) so flat triangles read as 3D
  relief. `spreadDrive` maps hand spread → apex (pinch flattens). Prototyped
  in `scratch/0*.html` (canvas-2D sims, keep for future look experiments).
- Shared print GLSL (videoUV/lumaAt/halftone/phash) lives in
  `src/effects/shaders/print.ts` — one source of truth for the print language,
  interpolated into both fingerShapes and facetFold fragments.
- `stringLines.ts` ('strings') — fingertip strings; `ink` param: 0 = additive
  glow, 1 = normal-blended pen lines.
- `risoCollage.ts`, `particleTrails.ts`, `motionEcho.ts` — see file headers.
- Built-in presets: Line Drawing (default), Cut-Out Studio, Blueprint,
  Wavy Ink, Gesture Study, Gabo Threads, Pastel Ribbon, Data Field,
  Print Window, Negative Space, Mosaic Lens (area treatments),
  Print Pyramid, Blueprint Pyramid (facets),
  Print Shop, Neon Strings, Full Collage.
- Presets are full snapshots: `PresetStore.apply()` disables effects a preset
  doesn't mention (so old presets correctly turn new effects off).
- Waviness vs vibration (strings) / breathe (shapes): `waviness` is a constant
  wave the line always carries (0 = perfectly straight); `vibration` adds only
  while fingertips are moving; `breathe` is the slow low-frequency wobble of
  the whole shape.

## Tracking feel (latency)

- Perceived lag is dominated by filter smoothing + camera capture, **not**
  MediaPipe inference (HUD "tracking ms" is typically <10ms on a dGPU).
- One Euro filter works in normalized 0..1 units, so `beta` must be O(1-10)
  (defaults minCutoff 2.5 / beta 6). Panel "Tracking feel" folder exposes
  `response` (0 calm ↔ 1 snap → `FeatureExtractor.setResponsiveness`) and
  `anticipate ms` (velocity extrapolation of tips to hide remaining pipeline
  delay). Both persist in localStorage (`fretart.tracking.v1`), deliberately
  outside presets — device feel, not artistic state.
- Camera requests 60fps (`ideal`, graceful fallback). More light on the hands
  → shorter webcam exposure → less motion blur and lag.
- `tips` are prediction-extrapolated; `landmarks` are not (kept honest for
  future chord/note analysis).
- **Thumb = the perceived "palm point".** When fretting, the thumb tip sits at
  the palm, so shapes/strings/particles each have a `thumb` param, default 0
  (tips only). All 21 landmarks are still tracked; this only affects visuals.

## Gotchas

- `THREE.ColorManagement.enabled = false` in engine.ts — the whole pipeline is
  raw pass-through; don't reintroduce sRGB/linear conversion without redoing
  all palette/shader values.
- MediaPipe handedness labels are flipped for unmirrored video; `handTracker.ts`
  corrects them. Mirroring is applied to landmark x in `features.ts` and to UVs
  in shaders — keep them in sync.
- MediaPipe wasm is copied from `node_modules/@mediapipe/tasks-vision/wasm` to
  `public/wasm/` (done at setup; re-copy after upgrading the package). Model at
  `public/models/hand_landmarker.task` (float16, downloaded from Google storage).
- Landmarks are mapped through the same cover-crop transform (`Engine.view`)
  the base video pass uses; screen space is normalized 0..1, y down.
- Recording (`recorder.ts`) captures only the WebGL canvas — the debug overlay
  and UI live outside it on purpose. Output is WebM; convert with
  `ffmpeg -i clip.webm -c:v libx264 -crf 18 clip.mp4`.

## Planned (not built)

- `src/audio/` module: mic onset/pitch detection feeding `FEATURE_SOURCES`.
- Chord/note inference from fretting-hand geometry.
- Reorderable effect chain.
